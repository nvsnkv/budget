# BudgetClient

Web app for Budget - online expence tracking and analytics service.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0.

## Development server
In order to work with API server properly, app must be served via HTTPS. Current dev configuration expects to have `./certificates/dev/` folder with `nginx.crt` and `nginx.key` files. Please create your own certificate files prior to run app.

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
